# credit_card_fraud_data
This project focuses on Identifying fraudlent credit card transaction  using machine learning .The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudlent transactions being a small percentage of  total transactions . To address this, I applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority  Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset it enhences 

#Steps followed in the project
-Data preprocessing:(Handled missing value ,scaled numerical features,Applied SMOTE to handled imbalance)
-Explanatory Data Analysiss(Visualized  fraud vs non-fraud transaction,identified key patterns in fraudlentt transaction)
-Model Training &Evaluation(train and test model ,evaluate performance using precision,recall and F1-score)

Results 
*precision: class 0 (fraud)86% of the predicted fraud cases were actually fraud and 1(non fraud cases) 1.00)
*Recall:class 0 (fraud 99% detected all fraud cases and class 1(fraud) was 99% )
f1 score class 0(non fraud):1.00 class 1(fraud):0.92
